## Features ##

- Configuration is now done with media query expression strings instead of using arrays of numbers. This enables taking advantage to the full [media query syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries).

- Subscribers are now executed whenever there's a change in both the viewport's `matched` and `current` state. This provides support for use cases where viewports had overlapping ranges.


## Enhancements ##

- The `subscribe()` method now includes support for an array of viewport names.

- API now warns when any instance methods are used in an environment that doesn't support `matchMedia`. This is done to help in preventing memory leaks when used in server-side rendered apps.


## Breaking Changes ##

- Replaced `width` and `height` properties with the `query` property.

- Subscribing to all viewports using the reserved viewport name `*` has been replaced with the `subscribeAll()` method.

- Subscribers are now executed whenever there's a change in both the viewport's `matched` and `current` state. Previously, this only happened when there was a change to the viewport's `current` state.

- Removed `options`. I've have yet to see `delay` used and `units` is no longer needed.
