## New Features ##

- Viewport configuration is now done with media query expression strings instead of using arrays of numbers. This enables taking advantage to the full [media query syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries).

    ```js
    const vpjs = viewportjs( [
      {
        name: 'small',
        query: '(min-width: 500px )'
      }
    ] );
    ```

- Subscribing to configured viewports can now be done by using the viewport's name alias or the `subscribe()`. For example:

    ```js
    // The following syntaxes are equivalent
    vpjs.subscribe( 'small', state => {} );
    vpjs.small( state => {} );
    ```


## Enhancements ##

- The `subscribe()` method now includes support for an array of viewport names.

- API now warns when `subscribe()` or `subscribeAll()` is used in an environment that doesn't support `matchMedia`. This is done to help in preventing memory leaks when used in server-side rendered apps.

- The `current()` method now supports a `name` argument and returns a boolean based on the viewport's `current` state. This aligns it with how `matches()` has always behaved.


## Breaking Changes ##

- Replaced `width` and `height` properties with the `query` property.

- Subscriber handlers now receive only a `state` argument instead of 2. Also, this `state` is not the same as the previous viewport object. For example:

    ```js
    vpjs.subscribe( 'small', state => {

      console.log( state );
      // { name: 'string', matches: boolean, current: boolean }

    } );
    ```

- Subscribers are now executed whenever there's a change in both the viewport's `matched` or `current` state. Previously, this only happened when there was a change to the viewport's `current` state.

- Subscribing to all viewports using the reserved viewport name `*` has been replaced with the `subscribeAll()` method.

- Removed `options`. I've have yet to see `delay` used and `units` is no longer needed.

- Removed the `is( name )` method due to the vague nature of what `is` meant. Did it mean `name` was the `current` viewport (yes), or just a `matched` viewport (no)? These checks can now be accomplished using `current( name )` and `matches( name )`.
